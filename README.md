# News-Topic-Classification Model Card

## üì∞ Introduction

Welcome to the News-Topic-Classification repository, a collection of language-specific models for classifying news topics. Each model is fine-tuned for a specific language, including Kimbundu, Umbundu, Kikongo, Chokwe, and Lua. These models are derived from the AngoBERTa architecture and were trained on the SIB-200 dataset, which can be found here.

üíª How to Use

## Install Transformers Library:
```bash
pip install transformers
```
### Load Language-Specific Model:
``python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
model_name = "cx-olquinjica/kimbundu-news-category-classification"  # Replace with the desired language model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
```
### Classify News Topics:
```python
news_text = "Input your news text here."
inputs = tokenizer(news_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = torch.argmax(outputs.logits).item()
```
### Explore Multilingual Capabilities:
Experiment with different languages and their respective models for accurate news topic classification.
